#  Mastodon Glitch+Urusai Edition  #

Added features:

- Links to our [Halcyon](https://halcyon.urusai.social/) implementation
- Larger emoji-picker for better visibility, especially on mobile
- Enlarge emoji in post content on mouse-over/tap
- Increased "Lengthy toot" definition so only posts larger than the instances max-length are collapsed
- Collapsed posts show >1 line of text, to help decide if you want to expand it
